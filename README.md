First of all, here's the link to check it out [here](https://codepen.io/w86compositor/full/WJoJpq/).

Hi fellow developers, today I want to share with you all the fun I had building the freecodecamp-weather-app. This was a fun challenge for me because it allowed me to play a bit with APIs and play with some JSON data which I love to do as well as to make some CSS animations depending on the weather. The requirements where those:

User Story: I can see the weather in my current location. <br/>
User Story: I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.<br/>
User Story: I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.<br/>
